# Golestan-Tea-Company-Production-Planning
This repository contains the models that my friend (Amirmahdi Amrollahi) and I have used for the production planning course in University of Tehran. In this project, we have used the aggregate production planning (APP) and the master production schedule (MPS) modules to determine the production plan from December to February for teabag products. By determining production plan, we want to find the optimum amount of production for each product, inventory and overtime levels in both modules. In this project, we have also performed sensitivity analysis on different parameters of the model. We have performed sensitivity analysis on the demand parameter for the APP module and the holding costa and production cost of the MPS module.
