# Tea-Company-Production-Planning
This repository contains the models my friend (Amirmahdi Amrollahi) and I used for the production planning course at the University of Tehran. In this project, we have used the aggregate production planning (APP) and the master production schedule (MPS) modules to determine the production plan from December to February for teabag products of a tea company based on gathered data. By determining the production plan, we want to find the optimum amount of production for each product, inventory, and overtime levels in both modules. We have also performed sensitivity analysis on different model parameters in this project. We have performed sensitivity analysis on the demand parameter for the APP module and the holding cost and production cost of the MPS module.
